          <p>&ldquo;The larger transactions are starting to dry up. Whatever liquidity that holders needed, they have gotten it done. They&rsquo;re bullish through the IPO,&rdquo; Robert Hilmer, head of business development at Equidate, which manages a market for trading shares of private companies, said last week. Equidate closed half a dozen smaller Spotify deals last week, but was unable to find enough willing sellers for larger buyers who wanted more than $50 million in stock.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are still reasons to think the stock could drop, and that holding out for a jump in price won&rsquo;t pay off. Spotify is going public through a rare direct listing, in which most existing shares trade freely on the first day and the company doesn&rsquo;t issue new shares. That will likely introduce more volatility than a typical IPO, where a small number of shares trade and investment banks might jump in and buy shares to stabilize the price. On top of that, the broader stock market has been volatile this year. A successful public listing by Spotify could inspire other tech companies to take the same route, although the number of companies that don&rsquo;t need to raise cash from a public offering is small.</p><p>There also is a more sober case to be made that slowing revenue growth combined with depressed gross margins could result in a lower valuation. Spotify faces competition from deep-pocketed companies including Apple, and saw its operating loss widen last year. Last week, Spotify predicted its revenue would grow 20% to 30% in 2018, lower than what some investors were expecting. RBC analyst Mark Mahaney, who is bullish on the company and set a target price of $220 per share, also outlined a downside scenario in a report last week where the company&rsquo;s growth slows to 22% per year through 2019, resulting in a share price of $123, below where some shares have been trading this year.</p><p>Still, a share price of $120 or higher would be a big win for most shareholders. That isn&rsquo;t a price any sellers were able to get as recently as November, and it is a big jump over the company&rsquo;s last equity fundraising round in 2015, which was at roughly $50 per share.</p><p>Holders of the stock believe there is a floor of around $120 per share, below which they and other investors would begin buying shares on the public markets. Their reasoning is that just about every Spotify shareholder has had the opportunity to sell their stock for $120 or more per share since December, because of the company&rsquo;s open stance toward private trading. Those that wanted to sell at such prices already have, with billions of dollars of stock having changed hands in the last four months. That doesn&rsquo;t leave many holders waiting around to cash out at those prices, they said. For example, Swedish telecom firm Telia announced on Thursday that it had sold the last of its Spotify stock, as part of a series of transactions over time totaling $272 million, although it didn&rsquo;t disclose prices or timing.</p><p>&ldquo;If you wanted to sell stock over the last two years, you could sell stock. It was liquid and easy to sell,&rdquo; Mitchell Green, whose firm Lead Edge Capital is a Spotify investor, said late last week. But now, he said, it doesn&rsquo;t appear many people are selling, even as prices have risen. &ldquo;Obviously at some price point, people will sell, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell where that exact point is.&rdquo; </p><p>Antonio Rodriguez, general partner at Matrix Partners, said he was offered well above $130 per share for his firm&rsquo;s Spotify stake last week and declined to sell. He said he wasn&rsquo;t very interested in selling for less than $150 per share and that the secondary markets have provided a baseline on which to value the shares. &ldquo;There have been a bunch of benefits, including support for a rising stock price, unlike who&rsquo;s the latest dumb money to mark it up,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Tiger Global Management, the second-largest outside shareholder of Spotify with 7% of its shares, is unlikely to sell soon after the company&rsquo;s public debut unless volatility causes an unexpected jump in price, according to a person familiar with the investment. The firm&rsquo;s venture capital arm, led by Lee Fixel, is likely already sitting on big profits. It built up its position entirely on the secondary markets, investing about $700 million in a series of purchases at a blended valuation of around $10 billion, the person said. The stake has more than doubled in value at the more recent trading prices.</p>
